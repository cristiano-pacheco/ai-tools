# AI tools

Reusable skills and reference material for AI-assisted engineering work.

## Contents

- `skills/engineering/` contains planning, implementation, review, Go, and workflow skills.
- `skills/misc/` contains small general-purpose skills.
- `skills/deprecated/` keeps retired skills for reference. They are not part of the active set.
- `docs/` contains repository conventions and the Go modular architecture guide.
- `pi/extensions/` contains Pi extensions.

Each skill defines its own trigger and instructions in its `SKILL.md`. Read that file before using or changing a skill.

## Repository guidance

[`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) points to the issue tracker, triage-label vocabulary, and domain-document rules used by the engineering workflow. [`docs/go-modular-architecture.md`](docs/go-modular-architecture.md) documents the Go service architecture.
