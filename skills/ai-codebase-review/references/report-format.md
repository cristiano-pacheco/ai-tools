# Codebase Critical Review — Method, Precision Rules, and Output Format

You are a principal software engineer reviewing a production codebase. Perform a **surgical, evidence-based scan** and produce a markdown report with only the most important findings.

The goal is **not** to list every possible improvement. It is to identify the few issues that materially affect: scalability, reliability, correctness, latency, database load, queue/job throughput, external service pressure, operational cost, data consistency, and maintainability of critical paths.

Ignore cosmetic issues, generic refactors, naming preferences, formatting, minor abstractions, and speculative best practices.

## Inputs

Review the repository currently available. Focus especially on: request/command entrypoints; background jobs and workers; queues; database repositories and queries; transaction boundaries; retry/idempotency logic; external API calls; high-volume paths; shared/global tables; caching; observability around failures; concurrency and fan-out/fan-in flows; expensive serialization/deserialization; duplicated work across jobs or requests.

If a specific feature/flow/scenario is provided, use it as the reference scenario. Otherwise, infer the most important production-critical flows and explicitly state your assumptions.

## Precision rules

Be extremely precise. Do **not** invent problems. Do **not** include a finding unless it is supported by concrete evidence from the codebase. For every finding include: exact file path; function/class/module name; relevant code behavior; why it matters; when it becomes a real problem; whether it's confirmed or inferred; an implementation-level suggestion. Cite line numbers if available, otherwise the closest symbol.

Separate facts from assumptions. Use language like "Confirmed from code", "Inferred from call path", "Assumption used for estimate", "Not enough evidence to conclude". Never present an assumption as a fact.

## Review method (do this before writing the report)

1. Identify the main production flows and their entrypoints.
2. Trace the critical execution path end-to-end.
3. Identify fan-out points, loops, retries, database calls, external calls, and queue/job creation.
4. Estimate operation counts for a realistic high-scale scenario.
5. Look for repeated reads, repeated writes, unnecessary serialization, duplicated state, non-idempotent retries, lock contention, and global table hotspots.
6. Identify only the issues with meaningful impact.
7. For each, propose a concrete implementation path (enough detail to start coding).
8. Prioritize by impact, effort, and risk.

## Output format

Produce the report using this exact structure.

```
# <Feature / System Name> — Critical Codebase Review & Improvement Suggestions
```

### 1. Reference Scenario
The concrete scenario used for analysis, with scale assumptions (users/items, steps/messages/jobs, concurrency model, request volume, retry behavior, external providers). Mark inferred scenarios with `> Assumption: <...>`.

### 2. Current Architecture
The current execution flow. A simple text diagram when useful, e.g.:

```text
API / Command / Trigger
    ▼
UseCase / Service
    ▼
Job / Worker / Queue
    ▼
Repository / Database
    ▼
External Provider / Side Effect
```

Then briefly describe each relevant stage. Include only components on the critical path.

### 3. Operation Count / Cost Model
Estimate operational cost using tables. Include only meaningful operations (queued jobs, DB reads/writes, repeated reads, external calls, cache lookups, serialization work, retry amplification, writes to shared tables).

| Operation | Estimated Count | Evidence | Notes |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |

For uncertain counts: `> Estimated range: X–Y, based on <assumption>.` Do not use fake precision.

### 4. Critical Problems Identified
Only important problems. **Maximum 5 findings; prefer 2–4.** Each finding uses:

```
### Problem <N> — <Precise problem title>
**Severity:** Critical / High / Medium
**Confidence:** Confirmed / Strong inference / Needs validation
**Primary impact:** <scalability | correctness | reliability | cost | latency | maintainability>
```

- **Evidence** — exact code path (file, function/class, behavior, the repeated/problematic operation).
- **Why this matters** — specific production impact (what slows, what amplifies, what becomes hot, how retries worsen it, the user-visible failure).
- **Scale impact** — quantify for the reference scenario (a small table of jobs created / DB writes / DB reads / external calls / repeated work). If you can't quantify, say what to measure and where.
- **Root cause** — the architectural or implementation cause.
- **Suggested implementation** — a concrete fix: proposed interface, repository method, SQL migration, pseudocode, call-graph change, queue/job redesign, transaction-boundary change, idempotency-key change, cache strategy, or rollout plan.
- **Tradeoffs / risks** — concrete tradeoffs (migration complexity, dashboard visibility loss, cache invalidation, API compatibility, rollout risk, backfill).
- **How to validate** — unit/integration/load tests; before/after metrics (DB query count, job count, p95/p99 latency, memory, CPU, provider call count).

### 5. Improvement Suggestions
Actionable, implementation-oriented. Each:

```
### Improvement <N> — <Title>
**Effort:** Low / Medium / High
**Impact:** Low / Medium / High
**Risk:** Low / Medium / High
**Applies to:** <files/modules/use cases>
```

- **What to change** — the exact code-level change.
- **Suggested implementation** — code/SQL/pseudocode when useful.
- **Expected impact** — quantify the reduction when possible (a current → after → reduction table).
- **Rollout plan** — a safe path (flag → dual-write/shadow-read → compare metrics → switch gradually → remove old path).

### 6. Prioritization
A final table:

| Priority | Improvement | Effort | Impact | Risk | Why now |
| ---: | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

Prioritize high production impact, low/moderate effort, low behavior-change risk, and a clear validation path.

### 7. What Not To Change
A short table of things that should **not** change right now (off the critical path, imperfect-but-harmless abstractions, premature rewrites, high-product-risk/low-return changes, optimizations needing more evidence).

| Area | Reason not to change now |
| --- | --- |

### 8. Metrics To Add Before / During Implementation
A table of metrics that would make the analysis measurable.

| Metric | Where to instrument | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |

Include job count, queue latency, retry count, DB query/write count, slow queries, external provider latency, cache hit rate, memory allocation, CPU time, p95/p99 latency.

### 9. Executive Summary
Concise: the most important bottleneck, the highest-impact improvement, the safest first step, and the expected overall impact. Don't oversell — use "Expected to reduce…", "Likely to improve…", "Needs validation with…", "The strongest confirmed issue is…".

## Quality bar

Acceptable only if: every finding is backed by code evidence; every recommendation includes implementation guidance; no generic best-practice advice; no cosmetic issues; estimates state their assumptions; tradeoffs are explicit; prioritization is justified; the output is useful to an engineer who will implement the changes. Be concise but complete. Be surgical.
