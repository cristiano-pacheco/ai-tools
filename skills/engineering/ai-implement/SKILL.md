Implement the work described by the user in the spec or tickets.

## Tracker tickets

When the work comes from an issue-tracker ticket, the ticket file tracks the work end to end. 
Follow the repo's issue-tracker doc (`docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`, "Implementation ticket lifecycle")

## Review

Run typechecking (make lint) regularly, single test files regularly, and the full test suite once at the end.

Once done, use /ai-review-changes skill to review the work.
